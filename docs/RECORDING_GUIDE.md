## KEY FILMING TIPS

### Do's ✓
- Keep movements smooth and deliberate
- Let scenes breathe (don't rush)
- Use full range of controls to show capability
- Record 2-3 takes if needed
- Pause between takes if something goes wrong
- Capture clean, professional footage

### Don'ts ✗
- Don't make jerky/sudden movements with camera
- Don't spam keyboard inputs
- Don't try to go too fast
- Don't be afraid to restart take if something feels off
- Don't record audio with keyboard clicks (narration added later)

### Backup Plans
- If a play doesn't look good, wait for next play to start over
- If AI View glitches, exit (ESC) and try again
- If drones behave strangely, reset sim and restart
- Capture multiple takes of each scene—use best takes in post

## POST-PRODUCTION STEPS

### 1. Export Raw Video
- Export from recording software as MP4
- Ensure 1920x1080 or 4K resolution
- 60 fps is ideal
- H.264 codec

### 2. Trim to 90 Seconds
- Use video editor (DaVinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere, or simple ffmpeg)
- Trim to exactly 90 seconds
- Ensure smooth edits between scenes

### 3. Add Narration
**Use one of these services:**
- **Gemini**: Use Gemini's text-to-speech with provided script
- **Pipecat**: Open-source voice generation
- **LiveKit**: Real-time audio generation
- **ElevenLabs**: Professional voice synthesis (paid)

**Narration script** is in `DEMO_SCRIPT.md`

### 4. Audio Mixing
- Layer narration over video
- Keep narration at -18dB to -12dB
- Add subtle background music underneath
- Fade out at end

### 5. Color & Grading (Optional)
- Boost saturation slightly (+10-15%)
- Increase contrast for more pop
- Add subtle blue tint to highlights
- Color correct if needed

### 6. Final Exports
- **YouTube**: 1920x1080, H.264, AAC audio
- **Social Media**: Square crop 1080x1080 + vertical 1080x1920
- **Presentation**: Same as YouTube

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Drones flying erratically
**Solution**:
- Let simulation settle for 5 seconds before recording
- Restart if they seem unstable
- Formation should stabilize after initial deployment

### Problem: FPS drops during multi-view
**Solution**:
- Close other browser tabs
- Reduce display refresh rate if needed
- This is okay—narration can cover brief pauses

### Problem: AI View looks blurry
**Solution**:
- Zoom out a bit with scroll wheel
- Adjust camera position with arrow keys
- Make sure you're not too close (minimum 3m from focus point)

### Problem: Arrow keys not responding
**Solution**:
- Make sure AI View is active (check overlay)
- Check if R toggled rotation mode (press R to go back to movement)
- Restart AI View by pressing ESC then clicking button again

### Problem: Control panel shows during recording
**Solution**:
- Press P to hide it before recording
- It will stay hidden unless you press P again
