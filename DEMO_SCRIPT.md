## ACT 1: THE PROBLEM (0-15 seconds)

### Scene 1: Static Camera Shot (0-5 sec)
**Camera View**: Broadcast camera view (View Mode 2)
**Action**:
- Show traditional football broadcast perspective
- Single fixed camera angle following the action
- Players moving across field, limited visibility

**Visual**: Keep it simple, show limitations
- One static angle
- Can't see what's happening on far side of field

**Narration** (to be added):
*"Traditional sports broadcasting relies on a single camera angle. You see what they want you to see. But what about the moments you can't capture?"*

---

### Scene 2: Reveal the Problem (5-15 sec)
**Camera View**: Free camera panning (View Mode 1)
**Action**:
- Slowly pan camera to show entire field
- Emphasize the volume of space
- Highlight gaps where single camera can't reach

**Visual**: Cinematic arc that reveals scope
- Show stadium scale
- Demonstrate blind spots from broadcast angle

**Narration**:
*"Traditional coverage leaves massive blind spots. Every missed angle is a lost story."*

---

## ACT 2: THE SOLUTION (15-50 seconds)

### Scene 3: Drone Fleet Deployment (15-25 sec)
**Camera View**: Free camera (View Mode 1)
**Action**:

- Ball in interesting position

**Narration**:
*"But here's the magic: from these 12 perspectives, AI can synthesize completely new camera paths. Virtual cameras that never existed. Flying through the frozen moment in ways no physical drone could."*

**Demo Moves**:
- Start in movement mode
- Move forward 2-3 seconds
- Strafe left, then right
- Move upward for higher perspective
- Zoom out briefly
- Optional: Press R to switch to auto-rotation mode, let it orbit for 3 seconds

**Camera View**: Return to Free Camera (press ESC from AI View)
**Action**:
- Go back to main view
- Restart a new play
- Show drones re-deploying
- Demonstrate view switching (1, 2, 3, 4 keys)
- Quick cuts between views:
  - Free Camera (1)
  - Broadcast (2)
  - Drone POV (3)
  - Point Cloud disabled view (just use free view)

**Visual**: Montage of different perspectives

**Narration**:
*"Directors can switch between any perspective in real-time. Create dynamic narratives. Every angle. Every story. All from one capture session."*

---

### Scene 7: The Future (65-85 sec)
**Camera View**: Return to AI View with impressive shot
**Action**:
1. Start a dramatic play
2. Wait for exciting moment (good player formation, ball action)
3. Click AI View
4. Use arrow keys for impressive cinematic camera work:
   - Slowly move around the action
   - Zoom in on key players
   - Create a dynamic reveal
   - Show the frozen volumetric moment from multiple angles

**Visual**:
- Cinematic, professional camera movement
- Clear demonstration of spatial understanding
- Frozen players/ball clearly visible
- Smooth, artifact-free reconstruction

**Narration**:
*"This is volumetric capture powered by AI. From 12 drone cameras, we've reconstructed the entire 3D moment. Directors can position virtual cameras anywhere. Create shots that would cost millions with traditional equipment."*

## ALTERNATIVE NARRATION (If needed)

### Shorter Version (60 sec)
*"Traditional sports broadcasting shows one angle. SkyStudio captures every angle. Twelve autonomous drones coordinate in real-time, capturing volumetric data from multiple perspectives. AI then synthesizes new camera paths through the frozen moment—shots that would be impossible with physical cameras. Directors can position virtual cameras anywhere, create dynamic narratives, explore every moment from every angle. This is the future of sports broadcasting."*

### Technical Version (for investors)
*"SkyStudio leverages multi-perspective drone capture with neural radiance field reconstruction to enable real-time volumetric sports capture. Our formation control system optimizes drone positioning for multi-view geometry, while our AI synthesis pipeline generates novel camera paths and intermediate views. This enables broadcasters to create dynamic, interactive content from a single capture session, dramatically reducing production costs while increasing creative flexibility."*
